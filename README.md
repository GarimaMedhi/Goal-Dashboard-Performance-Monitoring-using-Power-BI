# Goal-Dashboard-Performance-Monitoring-using-Power-BI
Project description

This project involves building a dynamic and interactive dashboard in Power BI to monitor and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) by comparing Target vs Actual data. The dashboard provides actionable insights by breaking down performance term-wise and overall, helping stakeholders identify gaps. Additionally, this dashboard is instrumental in driving business growth for the company by enabling better decision-making and optimizing processes based on real-time data. It's a pivotal tool that empowers your company to stay ahead in a competitive market.


Key Features:

Target vs. Actual Data Visualization: Clear comparisons using bar charts, line graphs, and tables to track performance metrics.
Dynamic Calculations with DAX: Uses DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for real-time, dynamic calculations of performance metrics.
Term-Wise Performance Breakdown: Allows users to view data across specific terms or time periods to evaluate short-term vs long-term progress.
Interactive Filters and Drill-Down: Enables users to filter by various dimensions like team, region, or date and drill into detailed data.
Real-Time Updates: Seamless integration with external data sources ensures that all metrics reflect the most up-to-date information.


Technology Stack:

Power BI: Data visualization, report generation, and interactive filtering
DAX: Custom calculations and metrics
SQL: Data extraction and transformation
Excel/CSV Integration: Data input and management for historical performance records
Value Delivered: This dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor KPIs effectively, promoting informed decision-making through data transparency. 
It simplifies tracking of achievements against goals, aiding in performance optimization and strategic planning.
